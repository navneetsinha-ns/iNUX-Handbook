# The iNUX Handbook Repository

This repository hosts the **iNUX Handbook** and a set of accompanying **project reports** developed within the ERASMUS+ project *iNUX – Interactive Understanding of Groundwater Hydrology and Hydrogeology*. Together, these materials document concepts, methods, and examples for the development and use of innovative, open-source educational resources in hydrogeology and groundwater management.

### Scope and Content

The repository contains:

- **The iNUX Handbook**  
  A practical guide describing concepts, workflows, and technical instructions for creating and using interactive educational materials.

- **Project Reports**, including:
  - Report describing the iNUX Web **Catalog** of interactive documents,
  - **Categorization** report (structure and indexing of iNUX materials),
  - **Question** pool report (digital assessment questions and formats),
  - Report on interactive materials for **basic hydrogeology**,
  - Report on interactive materials for **applied hydrogeology**,
  - **Best practice examples** report.

These reports complement the handbook by providing structured overviews, methodological background, and selected examples from the iNUX ecosystem.

### Online Access

The rendered and continuously updated version of the handbook and accompanying reports is available as a GitHub Pages site:

👉 **https://gw-inux.github.io/iNUX-Handbook/**

The content of this repository serves as the source for the online handbook and related documentation. The materials are **living documents** and may be updated over time by the iNUX team and external contributors.

### Educational Materials Addressed

The handbook and reports cover educational resources such as:

- Videos (field and laboratory demonstrations, software tutorials, explanatory formats)
- Interactive documents based on Python, deployed as **Streamlit applications** or **Jupyter Notebooks**
- Digital question pools for formative and summative assessment
- Enhanced classical teaching materials published as open-source resources

### Contributions and Feedback

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. The repository is intended to support reuse, adaptation, and further development of interactive hydrogeology teaching materials within and beyond the iNUX project.
