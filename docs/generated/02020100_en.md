## 1. Purpose and Scope

This report provides a concise overview of active interactive documents hosted in the iNUX GitHub repository and documented through the iNUX Web Catalog (Reimann et al. 2025; see access link below). The focus is on resources that are currently accessible and in use, including interactive Streamlit applications and other digital learning materials that deal with topics related to Basic Hydrogeology.

The report aims to:

- document the availability and usage of interactive documents for the broader topic *Basic Hydrogeology* (i.e., typically suitable for undergraduate education),
- summarize usage statistics for Streamlit applications (as of the end of December 2025),
- and highlight a small selection of the most frequently accessed examples.

The complete overview of the interactive documents is provided by the iNUX Catalog:

🠚 <https://gw-inux.github.io/iNUX-Interactive-Documents/>

and the GitHub repositories:

## 2. Usage Statistics for Streamlit Applications

For interactive documents deployed as Streamlit applications, usage statistics are available as unique access counts provided by the Streamlit hosting platform. A large part of the iNUX interactive documents is available as Streamlit applications and hosted through the Streamlit Community Cloud. An overview of the available Streamlit applications is provided under:

- <https://share.streamlit.io/user/thoreimann>
- <https://share.streamlit.io/user/thoreimann-0432>

Table 1 lists the applications with their categorization index and the number of unique accesses since deployment (the number of accesses is typically higher due to returning users). These statistics provide an indicator of global usage and visibility.

## 3. Selected Examples: Most Popular Documents

As a complement to the overview, this report includes the ten most frequently accessed interactive documents at the time of reporting (see Table 1). The selection is mainly based on access statistics and does not imply a qualitative ranking.

For each selected example, an overview document based on the iNUX catalog is attached, providing standardized insights and descriptions of the most popular resources:

- **06-04-001:** Pumping test analysis Module  
- **07-03-001:** Well capture zone  
- **03-03-001:** Analytical solution for 1D unconfined flow with two defined head boundaries  
- **06-04-006:** Theis drawdown prediction – fitting formation parameter to measured data  
- **05-06-001:** Mass balance for a decay chain  
- **05-05-001:** 1D Transport with advection and dispersion  
- **08-01-001:** Introduction to Boundary Conditions  
- **08-07-003:** Analytical solution for 1D unconfined flow with one no-flow boundary and one specified head/head-dependent boundary – Understanding model calibration  
- **04-05-002:** Infiltration capacity  
- **03-05-006:** Transient flow towards wells and superposition
