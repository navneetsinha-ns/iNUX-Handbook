# Abstract

This report introduces a categorization system for educational materials
in hydrogeology and groundwater management. The goal is to offer a clear
and transparent structure that helps users understand how different
resources are organized and why they appear in specific categories. The
categorization is intentionally broad and flexible so that it can
accommodate both current and future topics, formats, and contributions.

The system is designed to improve the findability, usability, and
long-term maintainability of materials within the iNUX (Interactive
Understanding of Groundwater Hydrology and Hydrogeology) framework. INUX
is an ERASMUS+ cooperation project of the Universities of Barcelona,
Graz, Gothenburg, and Dresden, aiming at providing an interactive
digital learning environment for hydrogeology and groundwater
management. The categorization supports the integration of materials
developed within the iNUX project as well as external content created by
the wider community. By providing a general yet coherent framework, this
concept aims to make educational resources easier to navigate, expand,
and reuse across diverse teaching and learning contexts.

# Motivation, Need, and Intention for Categorization

Hydrogeology comprises a wide variety of topics that build on
fundamental disciplines such as earth sciences, mathematics, physics,
chemistry and more. The field of hydrogeology and groundwater management
is highly interdisciplinary, covering hydrology, geology, chemistry, and
applied methods such as analytical and numerical modeling. Accordingly,
a clear categorization is essential for placing and finding different
materials, for example interactive documents, assessment questions,
videos, and others, within collections such as repositories and question
banks.

There are several reasons that justify a consistent categorization:

- to enhance interoperability between different users, institutions, and
  materials,

- to increase the usability of educational resources, enabling educators
  and learners to quickly locate relevant content and identify potential
  overlaps with their own developments,

- to support scalability by accommodating current and future materials
  so that new content can be integrated smoothly,

- to enable indexing and efficient searching of materials, ensuring
  alignment with existing learning management systems (such as Moodle)
  and repositories (such as GitHub/gw-inux).

The categorization intends to be as broad and inclusive as possible. It
aims to cover all relevant current and prospective topics in
hydrogeology and groundwater management. The primary goal is to provide
a framework that accommodates all existing educational materials
developed within the iNUX project, while also enabling the integration
of external materials created outside the iNUX core group. For this
reason, the categorization is not tailored exclusively to current iNUX
outputs but is deliberately designed to be wider in scope, ensuring
compatibility with all potential future content. Accordingly, the
categorization is kept general and comprehensive to reflect the full
bandwidth of the discipline, but at the same time aiming to facilitate
an easy navigation for (first-time) users.

A coherent categorization also aligns with the FAIR principles in
science and education (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable),
which are essential for the sustainable use of educational materials.
Moreover, categorization is crucial for the long-term use and
maintainability of open-source educational resources, such as those
provided by the iNUX project. Present and future users depend on a
complete and comprehensive structure to contribute and integrate
materials effectively. Finally, a transparent and well-founded
categorization strengthens the credibility and professionalism of
educational resources like those from the iNUX framework. This framework
provides the conceptual foundation for the subsequent description of how
the individual categories were selected and refined.

# Approach for Categorization and Underlying Basis

In the following, we outline the rationale behind the chosen structure
and clarify the considerations that guided its development. The
categorization follows a two-level structure with eight broad top-level
categories (first level), each further refined into subcategories
(second level). The top-level categories are intentionally designed to
be as general and comprehensive as possible. They align with typical
organizational structures found in established textbooks, such as Freeze
and Cherry (1979), Fetter (2014), and others.

The second-level subcategories provide additional differentiation while
avoiding excessive fragmentation. Their design is informed by the
content and structure of major textbooks as well as the practical
experience of educators and practitioners. If needed, future refinements
may introduce a third level to accommodate further developments with
enhanced aspects.

A key principle of the categorization is to ensure the unique placement
of topics and to avoid redundancy. This is supported by explicitly
stating the purpose of categories, especially for topics that intersect
multiple domains, thereby ensuring clear and consistent assignment.
However, placing a topic in two different categories might not always be
avoidable, particularly when materials serve multiple instructional
purposes. In such cases, users are encouraged to select one primary
category that best reflects the material's core intent and then
cross-reference the secondary category within the metadata or
description. This approach maintains unique placement while still
acknowledging the material's relevance across multiple dimensions.

# Documentation of Categorization

This chapter provides an overview and explanation of the categorization.
The eight top-level categories are presented in Table 1 for a concise
overview, together with the subcategories. In the subsequent text, the
categories and subcategories are further defined and the related typical
content is mentioned.

The top-level categories follow a logical progression that reflects the
structure of hydrologic and hydrogeological science. The system begins
with (01) Water Cycle and (02) Basic Hydrology, which provide broad and
general perspectives on hydrologic processes. These categories emphasize
conceptual understanding of atmospheric, surface, and near-surface
components of the water cycle.

With (03) Basic Hydrogeology and (04) Vadose Zone Physics, the
categorization shifts toward physical and process-based descriptions of
subsurface systems. The subsequent category, (05) Hydrogeochemistry,
extends the classification from physical processes to include chemical
reactions and geochemical interactions within groundwater systems.

Building on the conceptual and process foundations, (06) Experimental
Techniques and Methods groups methodological topics that support data
acquisition, field investigations, and laboratory analyses. The category
(07) Applied Hydrogeology integrates these conceptual, physical,
chemical, and methodological components into thematic and
practice-oriented domains relevant for real-world groundwater problems.
Finally, (08) Groundwater Modeling comprises topics related to advanced
numerical, computational, and analytical methods.

## 4. Decision help for classifying materials

The idea is that an author can walk through a short series of questions and land in exactly one category. From there, the list of subcategories should allow to correctly categorize the resource. The following Table 2 provides the questions to facilitate categorization.

### Table 2: Decision help for categorization

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1.** Is the central focus numerical modeling, computational workflows, parameter estimation, or simulation tools? | **08 Groundwater Modeling** | go to **Q2** |
| **Q2.** Is the core focus water in the atmosphere or surface system and its large-scale movement in the hydrologic cycle? | **01 Water Cycle** | go to **Q3** |
| **Q3.** Is the core focus catchment or river hydrology (runoff, hydrographs, surface water processes)? | **02 Basic Hydrology** | go to **Q4** |
| **Q4.** Is the core focus fundamental groundwater flow physics, aquifer behavior (Darcy, flow systems, well hydraulics, groundwater equations)? | **03 Basic Hydrogeology** | go to **Q5** |
| **Q5.** Is the core focus on the physical behavior of water in the unsaturated zone (soil physics, θ–h, K(h), infiltration physics)? | **04 Vadose Zone Physics** | go to **Q6** |
| **Q6.** Is the core focus chemical processes in groundwater (speciation, mineral reactions, sorption, redox, isotopes, solute transport)? | **05 Hydrogeochemistry** | go to **Q7** |
| **Q7.** Is the core focus laboratory or field methods (measurements, experiments, tests, site characterization)? | **06 Experimental Techniques & Methods** | go to **Q8** |
| **Q8.** Is the core focus a specific hydrogeological system, engineering problem, or applied domain (water supply, MAR, contamination, karst, fractured rock, coastal aquifers, geothermal, sustainability)? | **07 Applied Hydrogeology** | Rethink your answers to the previous questions, and eventually suggest a new category. |

## 5. Examples for Categorization

**Horton Infiltration**  
<https://horton-infiltration-intro.streamlit.app/>

The Horton infiltration app implements a physical model that describes infiltration processes in the unsaturated zone. Accordingly, and following the decision help (Table 2), it belongs to **Category 04 Vadose Zone Physics**. Within this category, the subcategory **04-05 Infiltration** is the appropriate and precise classification.

**Boundary Condition Intro**  
<https://gwp-boundary-conditions-intro.streamlit.app/>

The Boundary Condition Intro app explains boundary conditions in relation to natural hydrogeological settings and supports understanding of their conceptual and physical meaning. The app does not have a central focus on numerical modeling. Instead, boundary conditions are introduced within the context of groundwater flow theory. According to the decision help (Table 2), question Q5 is answered with “yes,” which places the app in **Category 03 Basic Hydrogeology**. Within this category, the subcategory **03-07 Conceptual Hydrogeological Models** is the most appropriate fit.

**Boundary Condition Module**  
<https://gwp-boundary-conditions-analysis.streamlit.app/>

The Boundary Condition Module belongs to **Category 08 Groundwater Modeling** because its central focus is on boundary conditions and their implementation in numerical models. Within this category, the precise subcategory depends on emphasis, but since the module examines the numerical implementation of several MODFLOW boundary packages in detail, it is best assigned to **08-10 MODFLOW Concepts, Packages, and Tools**, under consideration that large parts of the module deal with MODFLOW specific packages. The introduction part of the module would also fit to **08-01 Conceptual model development** but as it is not the major part, the module is not grouped here (cross-linking is possible and well suited for this case).

## 6. Conclusion and Outlook

The suggested categorization system for educational materials in hydrogeology and groundwater management is designed in a general and comprehensive manner that aims to cover the full range of topics within hydrogeology and groundwater management. The current implementation considers eight top-level categories, which are further subdivided into second-level categories. Some topics are rapidly evolving, for example data-driven methods, emerging contaminants, machine learning, and more. In response to this, the categorization scheme should be periodically reviewed and eventually enhanced.

The categorization is applied within the iNUX project to digital educational content such as interactive documents, electronic questions, and videos. The categorization may need revisions and eventually expansion with growing content.
