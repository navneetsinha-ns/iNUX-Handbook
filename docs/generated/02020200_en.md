## 1 Purpose and Scope

This report provides a concise overview of active interactive documents hosted in the iNUX GitHub repository and documented through the iNUX Web Catalog (Reimann et al. 2025; see access link below). The focus is on resources that are currently accessible and in use, including interactive **Streamlit applications**, which are primarily designed for guided exploration of hydrogeological concepts through user-controlled visualizations, parameter adjustments, and embedded explanatory content.

In addition to Streamlit apps, iNUX also provides selected interactive documents as **Jupyter Notebooks**. Notebooks are particularly suitable for model demonstrations and computational workflows because they combine narrative text, executable code, and results in a single document. This format supports advanced numerical methods (e.g., flow and transport simulators), allows transparent documentation of assumptions and parameter choices, and enables users to reproduce or modify analyses directly.

The short report aims to:
- document the availability and usage of interactive documents for the broader topic 'Basic Hydrogeology' (i.e., typically suitable for undergraduate education),
- summarize usage statistics for Streamlit applications (as of the end of December 2025),
- and highlight a small selection of the most frequently accessed examples.

The complete overview of the interactive documents is provided by the iNUX Catalog:

and the GitHub repositories:

## 2 Availability of Interactive Documents and Usage Statistics

### 2.1 Streamlit Applications

For interactive documents deployed as Streamlit applications, usage statistics are available as unique access counts provided by the Streamlit hosting platform. A large part of the iNUX interactive documents is implemented as Streamlit applications and hosted through the Streamlit Community Cloud. An overview of the available Streamlit applications is provided under:

- <https://share.streamlit.io/user/thoreimann>
- <https://share.streamlit.io/user/thoreimann-0432>

Table 1 lists the Steamlit applications together with their categorization index and the number of unique accesses since deployment (the total number of accesses is typically higher due to returning users). These statistics provide an indicator of global usage, visibility, and sustained interest in the deployed resources.

*Table 1: Streamlit applications and number of unique accesses.*

### 2.2 Jupyter Notebooks

In addition to Streamlit applications, iNUX provides selected interactive documents as Jupyter Notebooks. These documents are typically not deployed through a centralized hosting platform that provides comparable usage statistics. Instead, they are accessed via the iNUX GitHub repository and typically executed locally. Jupyter Notebooks primarily serve as transparent model demonstrations and computational workflows, complementing the Streamlit apps by supporting reproducibility, code inspection, and advanced numerical analyses.

Table 2 lists five popular Jupyter Notebooks that were frequently used in education.
