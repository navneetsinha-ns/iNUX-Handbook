# Interactive Documents – Applied Hydrogeology

This report provides an **overview and selected examples of interactive digital learning materials for Applied Hydrogeology** developed within the iNUX project.

The focus is on interactive documents that support **practice-oriented and method-oriented learning**, including **Streamlit applications** and **Jupyter Notebooks** that address applied hydrogeological problems, numerical modeling workflows, and decision-oriented use cases. In addition to documenting the availability of these resources, the report summarizes **usage statistics for deployed Streamlit applications** and highlights a selection of frequently used examples.

The selected materials cover a broad range of applied topics, such as groundwater management, boundary-condition analysis, aquifer characterization, infiltration and recharge estimation, unsaturated-zone processes, solute and heat transport, and numerical groundwater modeling using MODFLOW and related tools. Jupyter Notebooks complement the Streamlit applications by providing transparent, reproducible computational workflows for advanced analyses and model demonstrations.

This document represents a **static snapshot** of the interactive documents for Applied Hydrogeology at the time of publication. The complete and continuously updated collection of interactive materials is maintained through the iNUX web catalog and associated GitHub repositories.

### Online Version

The most recent and authoritative version of the overview for interactive documents in Applied Hydrogeology is available as part of the iNUX Handbook:
