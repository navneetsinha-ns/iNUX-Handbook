# Electronic Questions and Assessments

This report documents the **concept, design principles, and implementation workflows** for electronic questions and digital assessments developed within the iNUX project.

Electronic questions play a central role in the iNUX educational framework by supporting diagnostic, formative, and self-assessment activities across interactive learning materials. The report introduces fundamental concepts of assessment design, including learning objectives, constructive alignment, and Bloom’s taxonomy, and discusses benefits and limitations of different question formats with a particular focus on multiple-choice questions.

In addition, the report describes the **technical implementation** of questions within the iNUX ecosystem. This includes the definition of the lightweight and platform-independent **iNUX JSON format**, as well as workflows for transferring questions into widely used assessment formats such as Moodle XML and QTI 2.1. The report further introduces the **iNUX question pool**, which organizes questions according to the project’s categorization framework and provides them in multiple formats for reuse in interactive applications, learning-management systems, and classroom settings.

This document represents a **static snapshot** of the digital questions and assessments concept at the time of publication. The question pool and associated tools are designed as living resources that can be continuously extended and refined beyond the project duration.

### Online Version
