# Interactive Documents – Basic Hydrogeology

This report provides an **overview and selected examples of interactive digital learning materials for Basic Hydrogeology** developed within the iNUX project.

The focus is on interactive documents that are actively used and publicly accessible, including **Streamlit applications** and complementary digital resources addressing fundamental concepts of hydrogeology. The report documents the availability and usage of these materials, summarizes **usage statistics for Streamlit applications**, and highlights a selection of the most frequently accessed examples at the time of reporting.

The selected examples cover key topics typically addressed in undergraduate hydrogeology education, such as groundwater flow, flow to wells, pumping test analysis, solute transport, infiltration processes, and introductory concepts of groundwater modeling. For each example, standardized overview sheets derived from the iNUX catalog are provided, offering concise pedagogical and technical descriptions.

This document represents a **static snapshot** of the interactive documents for Basic Hydrogeology at the time of publication. The complete and continuously updated collection of interactive materials is maintained through the iNUX web catalog and associated GitHub repositories.

### Online Version

The most recent and authoritative version of the overview for interactive documents in Basic Hydrogeology is available as part of the iNUX Handbook:
