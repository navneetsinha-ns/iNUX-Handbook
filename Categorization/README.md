# Categorization Report

This report describes the **categorization framework** used within the iNUX project to structure, index, and consistently describe interactive educational materials in hydrogeology and groundwater management.

The categorization provides a common reference system for organizing materials across topics, formats, and levels (e.g. basic vs. applied hydrogeology), and forms the basis for the iNUX web catalog, usage statistics, and long-term maintenance of the repository.

The report is intended for educators, developers, and contributors who want to understand or apply the iNUX categorization scheme when creating, documenting, or extending interactive learning resources.

### Online Version

The most recent and authoritative version of the categorization report is available as part of the iNUX Handbook:
