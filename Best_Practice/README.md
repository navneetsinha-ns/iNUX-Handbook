# Best Practice Examples for Implementation in Education

This directory contains two reports documenting **best practice examples for the implementation of interactive digital learning tools in hydrogeology education**, developed within the iNUX project.

The reports focus on **didactic integration, practical effort, and lessons learned** from real teaching scenarios. Rather than describing the technical details of the tools themselves, the emphasis is placed on how interactive materials were embedded into lectures, exercises, and courses, and how they supported conceptual understanding and learning outcomes.

Together, the reports illustrate transferable practices for using interactive tools in both **Basic** and **Applied Hydrogeology** education.

## Scope of the Reports

The best practice examples address:

- Integration of interactive tools into existing courses and curricula
- Didactic design and teaching workflows
- Required preparation effort and technical setup
- Observed learning outcomes and student feedback
- Lessons learned and recommendations for first-time adopters

The target audience includes **university teachers, course coordinators, and educational developers** interested in adopting interactive educational tools in undergraduate, graduate, or professional training contexts.

## Included Reports

- **Best Practice Examples – Basic Hydrogeology**  
  Demonstrates the classroom integration of interactive visualizations to support conceptual understanding of fundamental hydrogeological processes, such as aquifer response to pumping. The examples focus on instructor-guided use in undergraduate teaching with minimal technical overhead.

- **Best Practice Examples – Applied Hydrogeology**  
  Presents practice-oriented examples targeting advanced students and professionals, including the use of Python-based tools and Jupyter Notebooks for groundwater model evaluation, comparison of observed and simulated data, and interpretation of model performance.

Both reports represent **static snapshots** of best practice implementations at the time of publication. The underlying interactive tools and accompanying documentation are maintained as living resources within the iNUX repositories.

### Online Version

The most recent and authoritative versions of the best practice examples are available as part of the iNUX Handbook:
